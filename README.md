## ${\color{yellow} (Sales\ Analysis\ using\ MySQL)}$

## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate foundational SQL skills by creating and querying relational datasets. The project focuses on student information and sales data to perform real-world data analysis using SQL.

## 🛠 Tools Used
MySQL – For writing and executing SQL queries

Excel – Source for sales data

DBMS – Used to manage and visualize databases (e.g., MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin)

## 🧩 Steps Included
Created a basic student table (BFSI) with fields like ID, Name, Gender, Course, and Fee.

Filtered sales by region, country, and city

Identified missing city data

Used wildcards to match patterns in country and region fields

Aggregated revenue by region and country

Sorted sales data in ascending and descending order by amount

Identified top-performing products and regions

## 🔍 Key Insights
The North region generated the maximum revenue

Top 3 countries by revenue were identified

Specific shipping modes like Economy dominate in certain regions

Null values were detected in the City column, indicating data quality issues

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL for practical data management and analysis tasks. It highlights the ability to clean, filter, and derive meaningful business insights from structured data
